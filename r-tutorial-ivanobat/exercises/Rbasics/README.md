# Exercise

Folder content:  
- loops.R  
- functions.R  
- rng.R  
- README.md  


## Motivation

As a first step in working with R you will learn how to use basic control structures in R - if-else statements, for and while loops, and creating functions. Next you will get some hands on experience with using functions for generating random numbers.

Throughout the exercise you will use git version control. After cloning this repository, you can simply start committing changes (you might want to do it on a new branch).


## Instructions 

In all files you will find more detailed comments and instructions, spots where you are expected to do something and insert some code will be marked as: YOUR-CODE. Recall to save your changes with the git version control system, after you are done with a well-rounded chunk of code.

1. Complete the file `loops_inclass.R`.  
2. Complete the file `functions_inclass.R`.  
3. Complete the file `rng_inclass.R`.  
4. Complete the file `apply_inclass.R`
