# Exercise: Data pre-processing and analysis.

In this exercise we will use the dataset aging-population.2008.csv (available in the data folder) to illustrate how to implement a basic data analysis project in R, and generate figures and tables to communicate our results.

The folder structure consists of the following:

- `main.R`: this is the main file that one executes to reproduce the whole pipeline. By executing the `main.R` file in R one executes (in the right order) all the `.R` scripts located in the `source` folder.
- `source`: this folder contains the `.R` scripts that you must complete for the pipeline to work.
- `processed`: stores the processed data to facilitate analysis at later stages.
- `fig`: contains the figures that result as the output of the analysis (note that the folder is not empty because it contains a sample of the expected outputs for your reference).
- `tables`: same as in `fig` but with tables.
- `analysis`: other relevant outputs from the data analysis pipeline.
